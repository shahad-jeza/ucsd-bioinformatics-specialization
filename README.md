# UC San Diego Bioinformatics Specialization ðŸ§¬

This repository contains my learning journey through the [Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics) offered by UC San Diego on Coursera.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a course in the specialization and contains my notes, code notebooks, and solutions to assignments and projects.

## Specialization Overview

1. **Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)**  
   Understand how to find patterns, motifs, and k-mers in genome sequences.

2. **Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)**  
   Learn about genome assembly algorithms and real DNA reconstruction.

3. **Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes (Bioinformatics III)**  
   Align sequences using dynamic programming and explore BLAST.

4. **Molecular Evolution (Bioinformatics IV)**  
   Construct phylogenetic trees and study genome evolution.

5. **Genomics: Decoding the Universal Language of Life (Bioinformatics V)**  
   Detect regulatory motifs and analyze gene expression data.

6. **Finding Mutations in DNA and Proteins (Bioinformatics VI)**  
   Use hidden Markov models and apply Viterbi algorithm to gene prediction.

7. **Bioinformatics Capstone: Big Data in Biology**  
   A final project combining all prior knowledge into a real-world application.
